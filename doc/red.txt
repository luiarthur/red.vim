*red*  Some predominantly red color schemes.

Two color schemes are provided: `red` and `noir`.

To try out a color scheme, execute: `:colorscheme <name-of-colorscheme>`, in a
VIM/NeoVIM session. For exapmle, `:colorscheme noir`.

To set the color scheme at startup, add the following to `~/.vim/vimrc` (VIM)
or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` (NeoVIM):
`silent! colorscheme noir`

These colorschemes are ideal with a black background.
